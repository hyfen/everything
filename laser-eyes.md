# Laser Eye Surgery

"What was it like?" More than anything else, it was creepy.


## My first pair of glasses

I donned my first pair of glasses at the age of fifteen. I could see well
enough to get around, with great effort and strain. By the time I got home from
school, I had to take a long nap just to make it through the rest of the day.
My eyes were exhausted and glasses fixed all that.

More than a decade later, I was ready to do almost anything to stop obsessively
wiping the lenses of my glasses. Every tiny speck or smudge was perfectly
obtruding under my light but necessary prescription. Thin contact lenses were
more comfortable but didn't correct for my astigmatism which left my eyes
exhausted. Toric contacts were somewhat closer but the clarity would get
disturbed by each blink which shifts the orientation of the lens.

While I grew to appreciate a fashionable frame of glasses, several thousand
dollars seemed like a small price to pay to eliminate a constant source of
stress in my life.

### December 7, 2012

_1:15pm_ Pulled up to Dr. Furlong's facility in northern San Jose, CA. The
friendly staff blazed through all the paperwork I've had a week to pre-read and
initiated the signing-athon.

"I understand that there is no guarantee of perfect vision" — check. "I
understand that this is an elective surgery and there is no health reason to
require this surgery" — check. "I am here for laser eye corrective surgery" —
indeed.

I pulled out my envelope holding a wad of $4,900 in cash that we agreed on
earlier. "Would you like to take a mild sedative that will help you stay
relaxed during the surgery and sleep after?" I accepted the tiny sweet pill and
held it under my tongue while it slowly dissolved.

The receptionist led Tracy and me over to the *other* waiting area, where we
continued to wait for another few minutes. "No wifi or cellphones" sign here,
and the walls look like they're leaded just in case.

One of the technicians came over to take me in for preparation. I sat down in
yet another room, she turned on some pop music on a little boom box and prepared
a concoction of eye drops. Anti-biotics, numbing, lubricants. She cleaned and
disinfected my eyes and again we waited for a few minutes, listening to the
cheerful music as the sedative started to take effect. My thinking fogged,
decisions became short-sighted, breathing slowed.

Finally we walked into the operating room. Spacious, with various utensils and
machinery on the periphery, surrounding the centerpoint that is *the chair* which
pivots between two laser machines. One machine makes the flap followed by the
other which performs the prescribed correction.

Suddenly imagery of my childhood come rushing in. Watching X-Files, alien
abductions, brainwashing. When I was a kid, I thought brainwashing was the
process of severing your scalp and immersing your brain in a special fluid. I
imagined it:

"Anesthetic is applied, followed by pressure on the tip of the head as it's
pulled into place with suction. You don't feel much but you know the top of the
head is being sliced open, scalp peeled back, revealing the brain. It's
floating peacefully in your head's natural cerebrospinal fluid until
brainwashing begins. The anonymous figures in your periphery prod with
instruments. Adjusting and correcting the physical matter of your parietal lobe
while drowning the organ over with supplemental fluids to keep it lubricated and
responsive. Results are verified and the scalp is replaced."

Creepy.

This bizarre science fiction imagery felt all too familiar, but applied to my
eyes.


Before we get started, another quick eye check "and I'm going to place some
marks on your eyes to help the tracker." As with every other eye instrument, I
placed my chin and forehead in the holders and looked straight ahead. The
numbing eye drops were well in effect at this point so I felt nothing as the
technician gently poked my eye with some kind of marker—once on either side of
the retina.

All ready, off to *the chair*. I slid onto it and positioned my head to be in
range of the pivoting radius. My neck felt cradled and comfortable. More numbing
eye drops washed over my eyes and my left eye was taped shut. I laid here
waiting for Dr. Furlong for a few minutes as he wrapped up with his previous
patient.

A familiar voice walked through the door and re-introduced himself. Dr. Furlong
confirmed that I'm here to get laser eye surgery and what kind—as if I would
remember the subtle differences between the various generations of laser
technology, CustomVue, Visx, WaveFront, something something something—"I
guess," I responded after a pregnant pause. Smiles all around, we proceeded.
"We're going to clamp your eyelids open. You have a very strong blink reflex,
and while it's easier said than done, try to give into it the clamp as much as
you can or else your eyelids are going to be extra sore tomorrow from fighting
it." This is the first instance of discomfort. Once the clamps are in place,
it's easy to get distracted from them being there with everything else that
goes on.

At every step, Dr. Furlong talks through what's happening, what will happen
next, and what to expect. None of the discomfort was a surprise—I appreciated
this.

After the clamps comes the suction, but no sooner than another slew of eyedrops.
They place a tube-feeling thing around the retina which creates suction until
your vision blanks out. This was possibly the most uncomfortable part of the
process because the suction creates a lot of pressure on the eye, briefly
bordering on pain, but simultaneously distracted by the complete loss of
vision. It didn't feel so much as a fundamental loss of vision but more that my
vision was obstructed, like when you close your eyes. With everything in place,
I was swivled under the flap-creating laser and was told to try to stare at the
subtle blinking orange light—the only thing I could see among my otherwise
absence of vision.

The laser sounds like an old DOT MATRIX printer. Tra-dat-dat-dat-dat-dat-dat.
Within just a few seconds, maybe fifteen, it's done. I'm rotated slightly, the
suction is removed and my watery vision returns. I'm sure more drops were
applied as Dr. Furlong peeled back the flap of my cornea. You'd think this
would be the worst part, but it was bizarrely interesting. It took maybe 30-45
seconds to get the flap fully opened and immediately my vision changed to a
complete blur. Fascinating.

I think the suction thing was reapplied and I'm swiveled a few inches over to
the corrective laser, again told to track the light. Ready?
Tra-dat-dat-dat-dat-dat-dat. This is when you start smelling your flesh burning
a bit—not a huge deal if you've ever had a root canal, or partook
autocannibalism I suppose. With each laser burst, the peripheral of my vision
started glowing in an emphereal light blue, lighter each time. Not sure what
caused this effect, but it was like an unearthly aurora borealis inside my own
eye. Within 25 seconds, it was over. "You did great!"

The pressure on my eye was released and the flap was peeled back into the
covering position, this took another half minute and ample eyedrops.

"You can gently close your eye now," I complied and my freshly lasered eye was
taped shut. Time for the other eye. Unsurprisingly, process for the left eye was
essentially identical. (Fast forward a few minutes.)


"You can sit up now." My legs dangle off *the chair* as I'm offered a kids
juice to help ward off dizziness, primarily from anxiety. I can already see,
well enough to walk around and get a final examination, but things are foggy
rather than blurry. Dr. Furlong admires his work as he looks at
my eyes through his microscope. "Excellent flaps." We shake hands, I thank him,
and I'm taken to the previous room where I'm given additional drops and
care instructions. Tracy had the option to watch the surgery but opted to rejoin
me in the post-op room instead. This is where they taped the silly goggles onto
my face and gave me sunglasses to go over them. I'm warned that there is
bruising on my eye but it will heal, that I would be extra sensitive to
light, and that there would be discomfort and scratchy pain once the numbing
eyedrops wear off. This was an understatement.

Tracy and I nod, pack up the supplies, and head home.

I was pretty chipper on the walk back to the car—I could basically see already,
but my mood quickly changed as the sun was blaring through the window while we
drove home. Like a creature of the night, I hissed and tried to hide from it,
but the scratchy pain and burning kept growing as the car turned to reveal new
beams of light. Unsure of whether it was the light or just the numbing wearing
off or both, I wanted to get home and hide in a very dark room as quickly as
possible.

...

The next hour or two sucked the most, worse than the surgery itself. I took two
tylenol, which I should have done earlier. Later I applied the numbing eyedrops,
which I also should have done earlier. Both of these things helped. I applied
the numbing drops one more time later, but I should have applied them more.

Eventually I was able to fall asleep, and by the time three hours passed, I was
pain-free. My eyes still felt swollen and achey, but it was much more
manageable.

After waking up, I was bored but was instructed to keep my eyes mostly closed
for the rest of the night. So here I am, sitting in the dark, writing the first
draft of this post, with my eyes closed.



## Back to business

How do you find the best vision correction specialist in your area? You do want
the best for your eyes, don't you?

Turns out, a lot of people have had LASIK. Many of them have written about this
very unique experience. Ask your friends, ask your optometrist, read [some blog
posts](http://dweekly.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/lasik-experience-intralase-wavefront/),
check Quora, whatever. Once you get one or two decent facilities to check out,
make a free consultation appointment. This is a great opportunity to ask a
specialist what he or she thinks about other specialists. Many of them know and
respect each other. If a name doesn't ring a bell, consider it a red flag.

Most reputable places will offer all the same perks. Unlimited free corrections
if the procedure is not successful, free followup exams, etc.


## Negotiation

Everything is negotiable, and the price of a life-changing surgical operation
is no different. As long as you've found who you're confident is one of the
best specialists for your procedure, there are often a few levers to pull to
get the best price.

#. **Competing offers and seasonal discounts.** If you get a better deal from a
   facility that they respect, you might get a discount. This is not unlikely
   because these places hold various discounts throughout the year to keep their
   patient flow up during off-seasons.

#. **Health insurance.** Your health insurance probably won't cover this
   procedure, but sometimes you can get a discount as a consolation price. "Can I
   get a discount for being covered by $PROVIDER?"

#. **Cash.** Once you get the best price you think you can, try to shave off
   that final 2-4% by offering to pay in cash. That's probably $100, nothing to
   sneeze at.

Remember, you're not negotiating what technology the doctor recommended or the
quality of service. Some doctors may offer an older technology for a discount
but a downgrade is not worth it unless you're seriously strapped for cash and
can't wait any longer.
