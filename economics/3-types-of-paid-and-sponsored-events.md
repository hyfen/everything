# Paid events versus sponsored events, and the other one

There are three types of events, relative to their funding.

1.  **Paid entirely by entry fees**

    The event is organized to scale from bare-to-the-metal in proportion to how many people attend. These types of events are usually the most unique and clever in the way they provide value to the attendees.

2.  **Paid entirely by sponsors**

    Success in closing that much money means it's being driven by influential people with generous margins. The events include great perks, free food, and are run to high standards with great organization.

3.  **Paid partially by sponsors, remainder paid by entry fees**

    What probably started as an ambitious and imaginative endeavour is now recovering from the brink of disappointment by turning to faithful attendees for money. The resulting orchestration is half-assed due to lack of money and interest. Unplanned variability and lack of commitment yields a culture of most compromises, special cases, and instances of look-the-other-way.

    You didn't pay for the full cost, so you have no ownership of the expected quality. Yet you didn't attend for free, so you feel ripped off when the event doesn't deliver.

    Another variation of the hybrid is **variable remainder sponsorship with paid entry fees**, where a sponsor is committed to paying whatever the other sponsors and entrants don't cover. The variable sponsor is usually one of the organizers and will attempt to cut costs at every opportunity. There is no illusion that the event is being completely run by entry fees because the goal is reducing the "hit" the variable sponsor takes. No clever planning occurs for scaling the event based on the contributions of the attendees.

The hybrid is the worst of both worlds. I avoid these types of events.

One exception is when entry price and sponsorship is used as a barrier to entry. I don't have a sweeping opinion about these.
