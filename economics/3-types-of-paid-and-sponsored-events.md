# Three types of paid and sponsored events

## 1. Entire event is paid by entry fees

The event is organized to scale from bare-to-the-metal in proportion to how many people attend. These types of events are usually the most unique and clever in the way they provide value to the attendees.

## 2. Entire event is paid by sponsors

Success in closing that much money means it's being driven by influential people with generous margins. The events include great perks, free food, and are run to high standards with great organization.

## 3. Partially paid by sponsors, remainder paid by entry fees

What probably started as an ambitious and imaginative endeavour is now recovering from the brink of disappointment by turning to faithful attendees for money. The resulting orchestration is half-assed due to lack of money and interest. Unplanned variability and lack of commitment yields a culture of most compromises, special cases, and instances of look-the-other-way.

You didn't pay for the full cost, so you have no ownership of the expected quality. Yet you didn't attend for free, so you feel ripped off when the event doesn't deliver. This is the worst of both worlds. I avoid these types of events.
